# ScorePredictor-ML
This is a machine learning mini project I developed during my 2nd year of engineering. The project focuses on predicting the final score of a cricket team in limited-overs formats (like T20 or ODI) using regression models.

ML Concepts Used:

Linear Regression,
Data Preprocessing & Cleaning,
Feature Engineering,
Model Evaluation (RÂ² Score, MAE, etc.)
